# Finsearch-End-term-Submission
This is the repository containing our code for the RL model implementation test benched with the LSTM model for analyzing the returns for the Nifty 100 stock.

# Code Structure.
# 1) Data collection and visualization for understanding the the data.
   Started by fetching the data of Nifty100 for the last 6 monthes through yfinance and then visualised the closing value as specified.
   Used yfinance for downloading the dataset and matplotlib for visualising it.
   
# 2) Analysing using technical indicator and visualing it. This step gives us a first insight regarding the risks and whether to invest or not.
   We defined various indicators in the like MACD, RSI,EMA etc. to analyse the data and also visulised it.
   
# 3) LSTM model for the the future value prediction and thus analysing the returns and risks.
   We defined it using Tensorflow. keras library which had a pre-defined function of LSTM and neutral network layers which made it quite easy to implement the model and the analysing the efficiency of the model and the return and risks associated with it.
# 4) RL model -> DQN implementation using the e-gradient policy and actor function and analysing the risks and returns.
   Used the gym for making the RL environment and followed by various policy function, step function based on the DQN algorithm logic.
   Followed by the result of risks and returns generated by it.
