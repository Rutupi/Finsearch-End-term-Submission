# Finsearch-End-term-Submission
This is the repository containing our code for the RL model implementation test benched with the LSTM model for analyzing the returns for the Nifty 100 stock.

# Code Structure.
1) Data collection and visualization for understanding the the data.
2) Analysing using technical indicator and visualing it. This step gives us a first insight regarding the risks and whether to invest or not.
3) LSTM model for the the future value prediction and thus analysing the returns and risks.
4) RL model -> DQN implementation using the e-gradient policy and actor function and analysing the risks and returns.
